			Discover MichÃ¨s, the new hidden gem of the Dominican Republic made unique by its untouched beauty.

		<body><![CDATA[
			<p>Continuing its 68-year-long legacy of pioneering destinations worldwide, last December Club Med opened the company&rsquo;s first project in the Caribbean in 25 years.</p>
			<p>The new concept divides the resort into four boutique hotels so that all guests can enjoy a holiday tailored to their needs and desires. Club Med Mich&egrave;s Playa Esmeralda offers adult-only spaces, children&rsquo;s clubs for kids aged 4 to 17, and a variety of land and water sports for those looking for an active escape.</p>

			<h4>Your gateway to paradise</h4>
			<p>This region&rsquo;s unmatched beauty cannot be missed. Located 95 km from Punta Cana International Airport, Mich&egrave;s can easily be reached by driving along a scenic highway offering soaring views of the mountains. This hidden paradise features miles of untouched, tranquil coastline.<br /><br /> Local wonders provide opportunities for guests to discover new breathtaking sights and activities, such as Laguna Lim&oacute;n, a nature reserve with stunning waterfalls; Saman&aacute; Bay and its protected islands with native flora and wildlife; and Monta&ntilde;a Redonda, a round mountain with a 360-degree view of the luscious landscape, known for its photo-famous swing.</p>

			<h4>Eco-chic luxury at its best</h4>
			<p>The architecture and spirit of this 37-hectare complex was inspired by the local culture, created to enhance the destination and provide an exceptional eco-friendly luxury experience.<br /><br /> When you arrive at the resort, it&rsquo;s clear that sustainability is at the heart of everything. Some of the responsible initiatives include the elimination of single-use plastics at the resort, and the coffee and cacao products being sourced from local farmers. Even employee uniforms are created out of recycled plastic bottles, with more than 200,000+ bottles recycled for the initiative.</p>
			
			<h4>A place that fosters well-being</h4>
			<p>Club Med is known for its activities and entertainment, and Club Med Mich&egrave;s Playa Esmeralda is no different. Here, guests can take part in more than 25 different activities such as fitness classes, tennis, pickleball, archery, indoor climbing, circus activities, kayaking, snorkeling, aqua fitness, team sports, dance classes, running, yoga classes, and more!</p>

			<p>Club Med Mich&egrave;s Playa Esmeralda was made for wellness. Guests can enjoy the scenic treetop wellness canopy, oceanfront meditation classes and five different types of yoga classes: family yoga, gravity yoga, acro-yoga, aqua yoga and paddle yoga. The resort also hosts active experiences you can&rsquo;t find anywhere else, such as electric surfboarding, hobie eclipse (a stand-up pedal board), treetop yoga, and family paddle boarding.<br /><br /> Cinq Mondes Spa at Club Med Mich&egrave;s Playa Esmeralda offers a beauty salon along with single and double treatment rooms, reflexology, hydrotherapy treatments, hot and cold plunge baths, a steam room and sauna.</p>
