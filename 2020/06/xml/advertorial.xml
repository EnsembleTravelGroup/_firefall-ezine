			<h4>Who is Le Boat?</h4>
			<p>Le Boat is a leader in canal boat rentals in Europe with more than 50 years of experience in the industry. With 950 boats stationed across a network of over 37 different departure bases in 8 European countries, Le Boat arrived in Canada in 2018 and now has a local fleet of 24 boats available for rental on <strong>Ontario&rsquo;s UNESCO World Heritage Rideau Canal.</strong></p>
			<h4><strong>No previous boating experience or boat license required.</strong></h4>
			<p>All Le Boat cruises are custom built to be easy to operate - if you can drive a car, you can drive a Le Boat cruiser rental. Le Boat teaches you how to captain your boat at your own pace on a flexible itinerary while sleeping on board. Travelers can choose a 3-5 night short boating break or a 7-10+ night vacation. All of Le Boat luxury boat rentals come with a fully equipped kitchen, fresh linens and bedding, and top deck sun deck.&nbsp;</p>
			<h4><strong>Is it safe to travel on a Le Boat post isolation restrictions?</strong></h4>
			<p>The safety of staff and customers is of utmost importance to Le Boat. All boats are thoroughly cleaned at the end of each use and the company has introduced additional cleaning and social distancing measure for extra protection while following Ontario&rsquo;s new Health and Safety Guidelines as they begin to reopen the economy.</p>
			<p>On the heels of the Government announcements and loosen travel restrictions, Le Boat, is preparing to welcome guests this summer when Parks Canada opens the <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Rideau Canal</strong> on <strong>June 1, 2020</strong>.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Once it's safe to travel again, we believe that Le Boat is an ideal option for those looking to vacation closer to home this summer,&rdquo; said Lisa Mclean, North American Marketing Manager for Le Boat. &ldquo;Being on your own private cruiser allows you to sleep on board, set your own schedule, plan your own route and control your environment - you determine where you stop and whom you interact with, while you explore the beautiful and historic Rideau waterway.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Le Boat luxury houseboat rentals are built for the novice boater in mind. With no previous boating experience or boating license required, anyone can captain their own Le Boat.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Le Boat makes it as easy for people to be able to get outdoors and have an amazing getaway, all while exploring one of Ontario&rsquo;s best keep secrets ,&rdquo; said Mclean. &ldquo;If you can drive a car you can drive one of our boats, plus we provide you with suggested itineraries for a 3-5 night short break or 7-10+ night vacation. And with a fleet of 24 premier Horizon Cruises (five model sizes sleeping from 2-12 people) you can pick a boat that fits your party size and budget.&rdquo;</p>
			<h4><strong>Get away from the city and crowds to the wide-open spaces of the UNESCO Rideau Canal, Ontario</strong></h4>
			<p>The Rideau Canal is most famous for being the Guinness World Record holder of the world&rsquo;s largest skating rink in the winter</p>
			<p>but did you know that from May &ndash; October it transforms into a specular waterway of private islands, sandy beaches, protected wetlands, bookended by two vibrant cities and peppered with small, artisan villages along the way.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The 202km of continuous waterway stretches from Kingston to Ottawa and is a vast network of pristine lakes, winding rivers and canals, all connected by a historical lock system.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Cruising the Rideau by boat is the quintessential Canada holiday,&rdquo; said Mclean, &ldquo;After this long period at home, this will allow people an opportunity to get away from it all &ndash; go off the beaten track with family &amp; friends without the worries of being in the busiest tourist areas the whole time. They can choose to visit the city, or stick to the small villages,&rdquo; She added. &ldquo;Le Boat offers a chance for relax and see new sights from the comforts of your own private yacht.&rdquo;</p>
			<h4><strong>Travel in comfort and style </strong></h4>
			<p>Le Boat&rsquo;s range of watercraft offers you everything you need for a comfortable stay on the water including a fully equipped kitchen, and private en-suite bathrooms with showers in every cabin. Spacious interior, top deck &ldquo;fun deck&rdquo; with sun shade and BBQ, making for the perfect setting to relax or stargaze with the family or group of friends.</p>
			<p>A private houseboat vacation is ideal for outdoor activities. One can enjoy a BBQ &amp; summer cocktail from the top deck at sunset, or enjoy fishing, kayaking, biking, swimming, or a hike on one of the many trails in the area.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sit back, relax, listen to the music and enjoy a fresh summer breeze from the comfort of the lounge chair, all while enjoy the breathtaking scenery as you cruise the Rideau Canal,&rdquo; says Mclean. &ldquo;We expect that once some of the restrictions have been lifted, people will take advantage of a Le Boat cruiser rental to create their own unforgettable vacation that they will remember for a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
