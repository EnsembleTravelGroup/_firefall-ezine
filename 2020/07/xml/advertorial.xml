			<h4>Keeping You &amp; Their Staff Safe Together</h4>
			<p>As you start to plan your getaways again, your safety remains Club Med&rsquo;s top priority. That is why they are thrilled to announce <em>Safe Together</em>, a new series of hygiene &amp; safety measures that were created by Club Med's International Scientific Committee comprised of a specialized team of doctors and professors. These measures are being implemented worldwide in all resorts and include, but are not limited to, the following changes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Capped capacity at 70%</li>
				<li>Face-masks &amp; gloves worn by staff</li>
				<li>Floor markings to reinforce social distancing</li>
				<li>Temperature checks upon check-in</li>
				<li>Increased schedules for the deep cleaning of accommodations, public spaces and equipment</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br/>
			
			<h4>Travel &amp; Book with Peace of Mind</h4>
			<p>Club Med also knows just how important it is for you to have complete flexibility on your travel plans, which is why Club Med offers <em>free cancellations up to 15 days prior to departure</em> for new bookings made on or after May 18, 2020, issuing full refund on the land portion of stays on and prior to December 18, 2020.</p>
			<p>Plus, guests who are ready to book early on their 2021 getaway will enjoy Club Medâ€™s Best Rate Guarantee, so anyone who find a lower price in the future on their same travel dates will receive a Future Travel Credit for a value equal to the price difference that can be used toward their next booking.</p>
			
			<br/>
			
			<h4>All-Inclusive Amenities, Unforgettable Experiences</h4>
			<p>From the moment you begin your Club Med vacation, everything is taken care of, from airport transfers to more than 25 on-site sports &amp; activities. That&rsquo;s only the beginning too &ndash; each resort is also home to various gourmet cuisine options, premium open bars, and live entertainment for families, couples, and adventure-seekers alike to enjoy at their leisure.</p>
			<p>Guests can also take their vacations to the next level by trying out new experiences only available through Club Med, from channeling their inner acrobat at CREACTIVE by Cirque du Soleil, a circus playground at Club Med Punta Cana, to enjoying the ultimate pool day at the new Aguamarina Family Oasis at Club Med Canc&uacute;n Yucat&aacute;n.</p>
