			The long-awaited time has come &hellip; to get back out there! We&rsquo;ve spent months at a slower pace, staying safe and dreaming of the moment when we could once again board a plane, set sail, or even hear a conductor say, &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; This time of reflection has had a silver lining; it taught us to take a step back, slow down, and appreciate what truly matters in life. And, if you&rsquo;re like us, travel made the cut.&nbsp;

			There&rsquo;s something utterly magical about the transformation travel can create. Travel is about more than simply arriving to a new destination, ready for a much-deserved vacation. It&rsquo;s about returning home with new experiences and fresh perspectives. As Anthony Bourdain once said, &ldquo;Travel changes you. As you move through this life and this world, you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life &ndash; and travel &ndash; leaves marks on you.&rdquo;<br /><br />It&rsquo;s time for new marks to be made. It&rsquo;s time to reunite with travel.
