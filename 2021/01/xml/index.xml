			If there has ever been a year that people were most excited about its arrival, we&rsquo;d argue to say it&rsquo;s this one. The long-awaited 2021 is finally here, and we&rsquo;re hoping for the best year yet. But, 2020 didn&rsquo;t pass us by without making a positive mark &ndash; our perspectives were renewed, our businesses were reimagined, and our hearts were reset. In a year filled with grief and hardship, we somehow found a silver lining, and that is the proverbial restart button we&rsquo;ve been given.&nbsp;

			So, as you sit down to craft your new year&rsquo;s resolutions, create your vision board, or simply dream of the good that 2021 will bring, ask yourself what you&rsquo;ll do differently. Will you choose to embrace domestic travel and discover your homeland? Will you stop waiting and finally book the luxury experience you&rsquo;ve always dreamed of? Will you opt for adventure that&rsquo;s coupled with activism and education for your family?<br>
			<br>
			No matter what you choose to do, it&rsquo;s a new year full of new ways to travel, and it&rsquo;s time to explore a new you.
