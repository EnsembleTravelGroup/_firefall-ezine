			One of the most incredible aspects of travel is its ability to change us. It teaches us lessons we didn&rsquo;t know we needed to learn. It alters perspectives we didn&rsquo;t know would ever change. And, it provides experiences that instill compassion, tolerance, patience, and so much more.&nbsp;

			But, why do we do it? Why do we pack our bags, board planes, and travel to places both near and far? Perhaps it&rsquo;s the adrenaline that makes us feel alive, or maybe it protects us from feeling complacent in life. For some, maybe it comforts us to know we&rsquo;re forever evolving into better humans, widening our view of the world. Or, perhaps, it&rsquo;s simply watching our children experience new things with pure joy and excitement in their eyes.<br /><br />No matter what your reasoning is, it&rsquo;s your motivation, it&rsquo;s your calling, and it&rsquo;s your &lsquo;why&rsquo;.
