			<h3>WELLNESS FOR OUR PLANET</h3>
			<p>As the world leader in expedition cruises, Hurtigruten has come a long way since first getting its start on the Norwegian coast 128 years ago.</p>
			<p>With the launch of the world&rsquo;s first custom-built hybrid electric-powered expedition ships, MS Roald Amundsen and MS Fridtjof Nansen, Hurtigruten leads the way in innovative technology for green and clean exploration to some of the most remote and spectacular coastlines on Earth.</p>
			<p>Each vessel is equipped with large battery packs, feature innovative green technology, and use electric propulsion to reduce fuel emissions by 20% &mdash;allowing guests to sail more quietly than ever before. These expedition ships are truly the first of their kind and take environmentally conscious expedition cruising to a new level.</p>
			<p>Hurtigruten has a great responsibility, which is incorporated into our mission to provide safe, unique, active, and sustainable travel experiences that create lifelong memories. To ensure the guests of tomorrow have the same travel experiences as the guests of today, we work hard to minimize the impact of our operations and promote sustainable innovation in the destinations we visit, by: supporting local communities; ensuring responsible consumption and production with the global partners we collaborate with; urgently combating climate change; and conserving the use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.</p>
			<p>In fact, Hurtigruten was the first major travel company to remove single-use plastic from all of our ships, restaurants, and hotels. These areas are where we believe we can have the most positive impact as a cruise-ship industry leader and on society as a whole, both now and in the future.</p>

			<h3>WELLNESS FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE VISIT</h3>
			<p>A Hurtigruten cruise is a journey for all your senses. Our chefs create superb dining from sustainable local and regionally-sourced produce, adding a delicious dimension to your travel.</p>
			<p>To tantalize your taste buds, our team of talented onboard chefs create sumptuous multi-course meals. Whether you choose to dine in the main onboard restaurant or upscale to the &agrave; la carte fine dining option, you&rsquo;ll find the cuisine varied, inspired, and downright delicious.</p>
			<p><strong>Cultural Cuisine <br /></strong>Exploration is about opening our minds to new customs, our eyes to new landscapes, and, yes, our mouths to new tastes. Our chefs may utilize unique herbs and spices or adopt traditional cooking techniques from the area, all to add authentic, local gastronomy to the meals they prepare for you on board. You can also expect some favorite Norwegian recipes on the menu, handed down through generations and a fitting homage to our long sea-faring heritage.</p>
			<p><strong>Local Flavors<br /></strong>Our chefs craft dishes that reflect the cuisine of the region we are sailing in, immersing you in the culture even more.</p>
			<p><strong>Plant-based<br /></strong>A range of tasty plant-based dishes are integrated as essential options into all of our menus.</p>
			<p><strong>Regional Suppliers<br /></strong>Sourcing food along the way helps to cut down the energy needed to transport ingredients and has the added benefit of supporting local small-scale suppliers.</p>
			<p><strong>Inspirational Lectures<br /></strong>The Expedition Team deliver themed lectures on how food and sustainability go hand in hand and often organize tasting sessions out on deck and during landings.</p>

				<h4>Seabourn Partnerships - Dr. Andrew Weil</h4>
				<p>This video highlights Seabourn's partnership with Dr. Andrew Weil. It features the Spa & Wellness program onboard, mindful living as a concept and why he chose to work with Seabourn.</p>

			<p>The program is led by the newly established position, The Mindful Living Coach. The Coach, will be a certified yoga and meditation practitioner who will inspire and educate all guests through various complimentary classes and gatherings throughout the voyage. Guests who choose to participate in this new program will have a cruise experience that is further enhanced by a holistic mind and body perspective.</p>
			<p>Central to the program is the daily practice of meditation and yoga through a selection of complimentary sessions. Guests can experience Mindful Meditation, which will introduce positive affirmations and mantras they can reflect on throughout the day. There will also be daily restorative yoga classes which will continue to focus upon the mantra and positive affirmations. Yoga classes will be varied, offering guests the ability to choose classes that focus on various physical issues, such as yoga to heal back and joint pain, headaches and body alignment, as well as yoga to enhance creativity, mental focus and happiness.

			<p>Integral to the wellness program are enriching complimentary Mind and Body seminars designed to educate guests on philosophies and practices that are aligned with the program's mission. Each presentation will aim to empower guests with ideas and practices that enhance well-being and increase the awareness of connection between mind, body, environment and wellness. Seminars are created by Dr. Weil and Steiner's Wellness professionals, many of which will be based upon Dr. Weil's teachings, and will explore the fields of the healing arts.</p>
			<p>Onboard seminars include:</p>

			<p>The Mind and Body Wellness Program with Dr. Andrew Weil deepens the already wellness-focused Seabourn spa program that offers a wide range of body massages, facials, fitness and beauty treatments. Lending itself to the program is the powerfully aromatic Thai Poultice massages that use the traditionally prepared steamed herbs of Camphor, Kaffir Lime, Prai, Turmeric and Lemon Grass in muslin poultices to melt away stress and tension, or nourishing desecrated Coconut that nurtures the body with soothing fats and lipids. Guests will also find Deeper than Deep Hot Stone Massage, Bamboo Massage and Freestyle Massage to engage their minds and bodies. </p>
