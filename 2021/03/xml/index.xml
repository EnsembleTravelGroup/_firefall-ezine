			Let&rsquo;s be honest &ndash; with this month comes an anniversary most of us would rather forget. It has now been one year, give or take, since the majority of us first went into lockdown due to the onset of the pandemic. It has now been one year of working from home, one year of social distancing, and one year of very limited traveling &ndash; and we&rsquo;re ready for a change.&nbsp;

			With this anniversary comes the need for a detox, a chance to unplug and remove ourselves from reality if only for a short amount of time, an opportunity to disconnect and unwind, and a moment to take back control and look forward to the future.<br /><br /> So, when the time is right and you head off to somewhere once again, remember how important your emotional, physical, and mental wellbeing is, and make sure to make time just for you.
